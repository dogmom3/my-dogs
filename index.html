    <h2 class="band">MEET THE BAND:
        <ul>
            <li class="waldo">
                Known for his rugged good looks and soulful howl, Waldo Puppito is the strong silent type. Mess with his girls and you'll have a price to pay.
            </li>
            <li class="arlene">
                Arlene packs a lot of punch for her small size, earning her the nickname Sassy Leeny. She is a fantastic backup singer with her signature small breed yappy vocals.
            </li>
            <li class="violet">
                Violet uses her tragic past as inspiration in her songwriting. Don't let her 3 legged status fool you though, she can karate chop you with that back leg!
            </li>

    <h2 class="history">HISTORY:
        <p>
            <li class="bio">
                Waldo tried to make it on his own as a singer songwriter for a year and a half before enlisting the help of Arlene. She added a certain flair that complimented his style very well. They had pretty good success as a duo and made it to the top of some of the pup charts. Several months later, they saw a friend in need and gave her a place to crash on the couch. It turned out that Violet writes incredible poetry, so they asked her to join the band and have been headlining sold out dog parks ever since!
