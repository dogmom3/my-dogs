# Waldo & The Howler Monkeys Fan Page

* AS A student, I am working on a project from the pre-work assignments. 
* I AM putting together a comedic look at mt dogs and their quirky personalities.
* I WANT to be practice my skills and become better at creating webpages.
* SO THAT I can be a successful developer
*
*
* This project was inspired by my love for my dogs. 
* I have a popular Instagram page for them and hope to one day create a comic book style cartoon about their lives.
* So far, this app only uses HTML and CSS.
* I will incorporate more programming languages as I learn them.
